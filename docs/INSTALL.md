## Building game itself
Project created mostly to build by CMake with several side depencies. For compilation there 2 variants:
- Get precompiled versions (Can be not compatable with system, are third-party files. **Use at your risk**)
- Build by yourself (More complicated way, require more time. **Recomended**)

## Precompiled libraries
For get compiled libraries versions check [releases](https://github.com/kolyaka32/tic-tak-toe-on-SDL-net/releases). There will be full file compect for build game. For correct work compliation copy libraries folder ('Program Files (x86)'/'usr') to it place.
Use this version by your own risk, don't trust everyone at internet.

## Building libraries by yourself
You can check full install sequence, depend on platform:
- [Windows](INSTALL-Windows.md)
- [Debian-like](INSTALL-Debian.sh)
- [Fedora-like](INSTALL-Fedora.sh)
